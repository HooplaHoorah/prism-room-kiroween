# Spec

## User Story
As a judge or player, I want a short, atmospheric room slice that demonstrates the kernel’s loop, so I can quickly understand how rooms will feel and how Kiro improves the build workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Toast, echo tail, and description work as specified.
- Hotkeys (`i`, `m`, `h`, `r`, Space, Esc/Enter) function and are documented.
- `/.kiro/` folder exists with steering docs and is referenced in README.
- No unhandled console errors; dev overlay logs last 3 transitions on error.
