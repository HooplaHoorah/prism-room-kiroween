# DevPost Write-up (Draft)

## Problem / Insight
Kernel-first lets us build repeatable spooky slices quickly, with specs & steering to avoid vibe-only drift.

## Implementation
Small state machine demo (enter→ping→echo→complete). Reliable toast, seeded runs, and accessibility toggles.

## Kiro Usage
Spec-driven acceptance criteria, steering docs for tech/accessibility/testing, and a demo on-save hook.

## Value & Future
Rooms as content packs (Skeleton Crew angle) and a path to a spooky SaaS (Best Startup bonus).

## Media
Add 2–3 gifs showing ping echo, toast, and Kiro folder.
